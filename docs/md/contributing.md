   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new compensation calculation feature"
   ```

4. **Push and Create Pull Request**

    it('should calculate compensation correctly', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```
